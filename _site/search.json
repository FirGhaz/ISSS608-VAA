    "text": "3.5.2 Developing Interacitvity using plotly\nLeveraging on plotly the interactive scatter allows the reader to (1) hover for details (Day and Rainfall volume of the day) , (2) select (via cursor, legend or lasso) and (3) compare data on hover. For Sn (3), the function allows the reader to have a quick glance to make a quick analysis on the Daily Rainfall trends across the years. For instance, we can observe that:\n\n\nDay 1 and Day 2 records rainfalls on all 5 selected years, therefore we can infer that the probability of raining during the 1st two days of December will be higher (of course a larger data sample size will enhance the accuracy of this inference).\nDay 5, 7, 29 and 30 records the lowest rainfall over the 5 selected years, this can only be seen through the compare data on hover function."
