    "text": "Past climate trends over Singapore have shown an increase in surface air temperatures and the frequency of heavy rainfall over the past few decades. However, the climate system is complex and the past trends and the magnitude of the change will not necessarily continue into the future. Climate projections using tools like climate modelling is thus necessary to project the future climate for planning and adapting to climate change."

For Sn (3), the function allows the reader to have a quick glance to make a quick analysis on the Daily Rainfall trends across the years. For instance, we can observe that:\n\n\nDay 1 and Day 2 records rainfalls on all 5 selected years, therefore we can infer that the probability of raining during the 1st two days of December will be higher (of course a larger data sample size will enhance the accuracy of this inference).\nDay 5, 7, 29 and 30 records the lowest rainfall over the 5 selected years, this can only be seen through the compare data on hover function."
