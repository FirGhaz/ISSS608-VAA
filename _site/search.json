    "section": "",
    "text": "This exercise aims to develop a Shiny application featuring an interactive choropleth map to analyze global trade networks in conjunction with the Big Mac Index. By integrating geographical data with economic indicators, the application will enable a visual exploration of how trade volumes and net exports correlate with price parity across different regions. The choropleth will serve as a dynamic tool to observe patterns, offering users the ability to drill down into country-specific trade connections and Index values.\nThe final deliverable will be a user-centric Shiny application, optimized for engagement and insight discovery. It will be complemented by a concise report summarizing the analytical narratives that emerge from the visualization. This endeavor will not only underscore the practicality of geospatial data in economic analysis but also aims to enrich the discourse on the implications of trade dynamics for market pricing mechanisms like the Big Mac Index."

Use view.legend.position in tm_view to set the legend position in view mode.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Building a Boxmap\nDistribution Overview: The boxbreaks function calculates the interquartile range (IQR) of the bmi_usd_price variable to determine the “fences” or thresholds for outliers. It then establishes break points for categorizing regions: lower outliers, the first quartile (25%), the median (50%), the third quartile (75%), and upper outliers. This approach provides a quick way to identify where the majority of the data points lie in relation to the overall distribution and to spot regions with exceptionally high or low BMI prices.\nGeographic Variations: By applying the boxmap function, we visually analyze the geographic distribution of Big Mac prices across different countries. This analysis can reveal patterns or clusters of higher or lower prices. For instance, higher prices in developed countries could reflect stronger currencies or higher living costs, while lower prices in developing countries might be attributed to lower production costs or weaker currencies.\nOutliers and Economic Insights: Outliers identified through this method can offer insights into anomalies within the data. Lower outliers might indicate countries where Big Macs are unusually cheap, potentially due to lower labor and production costs or subsidy effects. Conversely, upper outliers might point to countries where Big Macs are disproportionately expensive, which could be due to import tariffs, high taxes, or significant demand relative to supply. Identifying these outliers can prompt further investigation into the economic policies, supply chain logistics, and market dynamics of these regions.\n\n\nCode\nboxbreaks &lt;- function(v,mult=1.5) {\n  qv &lt;- unname(quantile(v))\n  iqr &lt;- qv[3] - qv[1]\n  upfence &lt;- qv[3] + mult * iqr\n  lofence &lt;- qv[1] - mult * iqr\n  # initialize break points vector\n  bb &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=6)\n  # logic for lower and upper fences\n  if (lofence &lt; qv[1]) {  # no lower outliers\n    bb[1] &lt;- lofence\n    bb[2] &lt;- floor(qv[1])\n  } else {\n    bb[2] &lt;- lofence\n    bb[1] &lt;- qv[1]\n  }\n  if (upfence &gt; qv[4]) { # no upper outliers\n    bb[6] &lt;- upfence\n    bb[5] &lt;- ceiling(qv[4])\n  } else {\n    bb[5] &lt;- upfence\n    bb[6] &lt;- qv[4]\n  }\n  bb &lt;- sort(bb)\n  bb[2:4] &lt;- qv[1:3]\n  return(bb)\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nget.var &lt;- function(vname,df) {\n  v &lt;- df[vname] %&gt;% st_set_geometry(NULL)\n  v &lt;- unname(v[,1])\n  return(v)\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nget.var &lt;- function(vname, df) {\n\n  v &lt;- df[[vname]] %&gt;% as.numeric() \n  return(v)\n}\nlibrary(sf)  # Assuming you're working with sf objects\nlibrary(dplyr)  # For the pipe operator\n\nvar &lt;- na.omit(get.var(\"bmi_usd_price\", wmpb_World_BMI))\nbb &lt;- boxbreaks(var)\nprint(bb)\n\n\n[1] -2.457697  0.798722  2.242142  2.969668  5.000000  6.226088\n\n\n\n\nCode\nboxmap &lt;- function(vnam, df, \n                   legtitle=NA,\n                   mtitle=\"Box Map\",\n                   mult=1.5){\n  var &lt;- get.var(vnam,df)\n  bb &lt;- boxbreaks(var)\n  tm_shape(df) +\n    tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(df) +\n     tm_fill(vnam,title=legtitle,\n             breaks=bb,\n             palette=\"Oranges\",\n          labels = c(\"lower outlier\", \n                     \"&lt; 25%\", \n                     \"25% - 50%\", \n                     \"50% - 75%\",\n                     \"&gt; 75%\", \n                     \"upper outlier\"))  +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle, \n            title.position = c(\"left\",\n                               \"top\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\n\nCode\nboxmap(\"bmi_usd_price\", wmpb_World_BMI_2020)+\n  tm_facets(by=\"continent\", \n            free.coords=TRUE, \n            drop.shapes=FALSE) \n\n\nWarning: The argument drop.shapes has been renamed to drop.units, and is\ntherefore deprecated\n\n\nWarning: Values have found that are higher than the highest break\n\n\nWarning: number of legend labels should be 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison by Continent: The use of tm_facets to segment the map by continent allows for an examination of regional trends and comparisons. It can uncover how economic, cultural, and regional trade agreements influence the price of consumer goods like Big Macs. For example: - North America although USA and Canada are top 50 percentile, Mexico is lagging behind the big mac’s indicator. - Most of the EU countries are also in the 50 - 75% and above as compare to majority of Asia which still sits at &lt;25% percentile especially in the South East Asia Region.\nStatistical Significance: While this visual method offers valuable insights, it’s also crucial to conduct further statistical tests to determine the significance of the observed patterns. For instance, analyses such as ANOVA or post-hoc tests can quantify whether the differences in Big Mac prices between continents or between outlier and non-outlier countries are statistically significant."

We can observe that Asian economies such as China and Japan occupy large areas, indicating a high GDP per capita combined with significant exports. Contrastingly, the smaller rectangles representing countries like the Philippines and Malaysia suggest lower GDP per capita figures. Additionally, the treemap highlights the prominence of North America, particularly the United States, which dominates the visual space reflecting its substantial GDP per capita and export volume. Europe’s diverse economic status is represented through varying rectangle sizes, with countries like the United Kingdom and Switzerland appearing significantly larger than their eastern counterparts, denoting higher GDP per capita ratios. This visualization is a graphical abstract of the global economic hierarchy and the interplay between GDP and exports in different regions.

These nodes may be pivotal in the beef trade network, acting as major exporters or importers.\nTrade Volume and Direction: The thickness of the lines could indicate the volume of trade, with thicker lines representing larger quantities of beef traded. Pink lines for exports are prominent, suggesting that the visualization might be from a major beef-exporting nation’s perspective, or these countries are simply key players in beef exports globally."

This suggests an increase in the global beef trade over the 19-year span. More countries seem to be involved in the trade network, indicating globalization and the diversification of trade partners.\nCentrality and Key Players: Certain countries appear as central nodes in both networks, likely indicating that they are key players in the beef trade. The positioning of these countries may suggest their role as major exporters or importers. Over time, the central nodes might have shifted, reflecting changes in trade dominance.\nChanges in Trade Patterns: By comparing the thickness and number of links (representing the volume of trade), it’s possible to infer changes in trade patterns. Countries that have a larger number of thicker lines in 2021 compared to 2002 could have increased their beef trade volume significantly.\nReduced Peripherality: In the earlier network, there might be countries that appear as outliers or peripheral nodes, engaged in trade with only a few partners. Over time, these peripheral countries seem to have woven into the fabric of the global trade network more completely, with an increase in the number of trade links.\nEffects of Globalization: The network’s densification is likely a result of globalization. As trade barriers have been reduced and markets have opened up, countries have broadened their trade partnerships, leading to more robust and complex trade networks."

    "text": "3.1 Network Centrality and Community Clustering\nFor our scope of the project, we will select 50+ countries with (1) significant trade activities and (2) complete data together with BMI(Index). A Trade Connectivity Index (TCI) will be calculated for each edge in the network will be calculated as follows:\n\nEdge Weight Formula: Trade Connectivity Index (TCI)\nThis formula reflects the proportion of beef trade (exports and imports) in relation to the total trade volume between two countries. It highlights the significance of beef trade in the bilateral trade relationship, making it particularly relevant for analysing the trade networks with respect to the Big Mac Index. Hence, this will be applied to our network edges.\n\nBeef Exports Value and Beef Imports Value refer to the value of beef traded between the two countries forming an edge in the network.\nTotal Exports Value and Total Imports Value encompass the total trade volume between these countries, providing a base to understand the relative importance of beef trade.\n\nNode Attributes\nFor the nodes, you can maintain attributes that reflect each country’s economic and demographic scale, as well as its relevance to the Big Mac Index:\n\nBMI Index: Directly use the Big Mac Index as a node attribute to represent the pricing level of a Big Mac, serving as a proxy for purchasing power parity.\nTrade Value: This could be represented by either Total Exports or Total Imports to reflect the country’s engagement in global trade. Alternatively, you might use a composite measure such as GDP to reflect overall economic size and capacity.\n\nWe will compute the centrality and community clusters to determine their community clusters\nIn our exploration of global trade dynamics, specifically through the lens of beef exports and imports, we aim to uncover insights into the Big Mac Index, a whimsical gauge of purchasing power parity devised by The Economist. Analyzing beef trade patterns grants us a direct line of inquiry into the pricing mechanisms of the Big Mac, considering beef’s pivotal role in its composition. This focus allows us to parse the supply chain intricacies and market conditions that dictate the variability in Big Mac prices across different regions. The rationale behind this targeted analysis is to use beef trade as a tangible metric for understanding broader economic trends and pricing pressures that ultimately influence consumer goods’ costs.\nTo navigate this complex interplay, we’ve adopted a formula integrating critical trade data and economic indicators to model their relationship with the Big Mac Index. This formula captures the essence of trade balance, economic scale (granular and macro at the same time), and the specific impact of beef trade. It correlates net exports relative to GDP per capita with the proportions of beef exports and imports within total trade, providing a nuanced perspective on how trade dynamics influence market conditions and, by extension, Big Mac prices.\n\n3.1.1 Centrality\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggraph)\nlibrary(igraph)\n\n\nbmi2021_graph &lt;- igraph::set_vertex_attr(bmi2021_graph, \"betweenness\", value = igraph::betweenness(bmi2021_graph))\n\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(bmi2021_graph, layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width = Value), alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = betweenness), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_node_text(aes(label = country), repel = TRUE, size = 2, hjust = 0.6, vjust = -1.8, color = \"black\") +\n  theme_graph()\n\n\ng &lt;- g + geom_node_point(aes(color = continent))\n\n\ng\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree Centrality Degree centrality measures the number of edges connected to a node. In directed networks, you can distinguish between in-degree and out-degree.\nDegree centrality is a measure used in network analysis to quantify the importance or influence of a particular node within a network. It is based on the number of connections, or edges, that a node has to other nodes. The central concept behind degree centrality is simple: nodes with more connections are considered more central and potentially more influential within the network.\nThere are two types of degree centrality:\nIn-Degree Centrality: This measures the number of incoming connections to a node. It can be particularly relevant in directed networks where the direction of the connection matters. A high in-degree centrality indicates that a node is a major target within the network, receiving many connections from other nodes. This can signify a node of high interest or popularity.\nOut-Degree Centrality: This measures the number of outgoing connections from a node. Like in-degree centrality, it is applicable in directed networks. A high out-degree centrality signifies that a node actively reaches out to many other nodes, which can indicate a source or distributor of information, goods, or influence within the network\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggraph)\nlibrary(igraph)\n\n# Assuming bmi2021_graph is an igraph object\n# Compute degree centrality and add it to the graph object\nbmi2021_graph &lt;- igraph::set_vertex_attr(bmi2021_graph, \"degree\", value = igraph::degree(bmi2021_graph))\n\n# Plotting the graph with ggraph\ng &lt;- ggraph(bmi2021_graph, layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width = Value), alpha = 0.5) + \n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, color = continent)) + # Size nodes by degree centrality and color by continent\n  geom_node_text(aes(label = country), repel = TRUE, size = 2, hjust = 0.5, color = \"black\", fontface = \"bold\") +\n  theme_graph() +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 10)) + # Adjust the range for the size of the nodes\n  labs(size = \"Degree Centrality\") # Label for the size scale\n\n# Display the graph\ng\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree centrality is a straightforward but powerful concept in network analysis, useful for identifying key nodes that might play critical roles in the dissemination of information, disease transmission, social network influence, and more within a network.\nEigenvector Centrality Eigenvector centrality measures a node’s influence based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question.\n\n\nCode\neigenvector_centrality &lt;- eigen_centrality(bmi2021_graph)$vector\n\nprint(summary(eigenvector_centrality))\n\n\n     Min.   1st Qu.

connectors or bridges within the network, potentially controlling the flow of trade.\nNodes such as the United States and Brazil have high degrees, meaning they have numerous trade connections, possibly making them central hubs in the beef trade network.\nThe eigenvector centrality considers not just the number but the quality of connections. Nodes with high eigenvector centrality, like the United States and Australia, are connected to other well-connected nodes, hinting at influential trade cliques.\nHigh closeness centrality for nodes like the United States and South Africa suggests that they can quickly interact or trade with all other nodes, indicating efficiency in their trade operations.\n\n\nSome countries much higher centrality, which could mean the trade network relies heavily on these nodes, possibly creating vulnerability to disruptions.\nDegree centrality can suggest potential market influence, with highly connected nodes being able to leverage their position for competitive advantage.\nThis measure reflects the potential for a node to access and influence the broader network through its connections.\nCloseness centrality offers insight into the speed at which a country can react to supply and demand changes across the global network\n\n\nCountries with lower betweenness centrality might have more direct trade links or may not be critical transit points within the network.\nA spread of degree centrality across the network would indicate a democratized trading environment, but a concentration suggests a few key players dominate.\nLow eigenvector centrality could indicate peripheral or less influential roles within the trading network, possibly representing newer or more specialized markets.\nLow closeness centrality might point to potential delays in trade flows or inefficiencies, possibly due to geographical or logistical factor\n\n\n\n:::callout: Summary of Insights 1. Network Roles and Big Mac Pricing:\nCountries central in the beef trade network, indicated by high betweenness or degree centrality, may have more stable and competitive beef pricing due to their numerous trade links, which could affect their local Big Mac prices. The presence of key influencers, as suggested by eigenvector centrality, could indicate the potential for price setting or market influence, which can trickle down to the pricing of beef and related products like the Big Mac.\n\nTrade Efficiency and Cost:\n\nCloseness centrality can signal efficient trade practices and the potential for rapid adjustment to market changes, which could lead to more competitive and stable pricing for beef, affecting the Big Mac Index. Any delays or inefficiencies in beef imports could increase costs for local producers, potentially raising Big Mac prices in countries with lower closeness centrality.\n\nCluster Analysis and Market Groupings:\n\nClustering helps identify groups of countries with similar trade patterns, which can show regional variations in Big Mac prices due to similarities in trade dynamics and economic profiles. Understanding these clusters can provide insights into regional pricing strategies for the Big Mac and indicate how economic or trade changes in one country might impact others within the same cluster. :::\n\n\n4.2.2 Computing Community Indices\nTidygraph package inherits many of the community detection algorithms imbedded into igraph We will utilise 3 community detection algo: (1) Leading eigenvector (group_leading_eigen), (2) Walktrap and (3) Spinglass (group_spinglass).Some community algorithms are designed to take into account direction or weight, while others ignore it.\ngroup_leading Eigenvector\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- bmi2021_graph %&gt;%\n  mutate(community = as.factor(group_leading_eigen(weights = Value))) %&gt;%\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width = Value), alpha = 0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = community), size = 3) +\n  theme_graph()\n\n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nℹ In argument: `community = as.factor(group_leading_eigen(weights = Value))`.\nCaused by warning in `cluster_leading_eigen()`:\n!

Nodes with high eigenvector centrality are connected to other influential nodes, which can form a community. Implication for Big Mac Index: Communities identified by the Leading Eigenvector method might represent countries with influential trade relationships or economic ties that can impact the Big Mac Index through pricing standards, trade agreements, or shared economic policies.\n\nWalktrap\n\nInsight: Walktrap finds communities by simulating random walks on the network, with the idea that walks are “trapped” within densely connected parts of the graph. Implication for Big Mac Index: The communities detected could reflect clusters of countries where trade flow is more frequent or robust, possibly due to geographic proximity or trade agreements, which in turn may affect the local pricing strategies included in the Big Mac Index.\n\nSpinglass\n\nInsight: This method uses a spin model from statistical mechanics and is particularly good at detecting community structures where communities may be hierarchically nested. Implication for Big Mac Index: Spinglass communities may reflect complex and layered trade relationships, possibly uncovering hierarchies in economic interactions that could influence the Big Mac Index.\n\nComparison Summary:\n\nThe Leading Eigenvector method might highlight dominant countries in trade that potentially set benchmarks for the Big Mac Index. The Walktrap method may reveal more about regional trading blocks or groups of countries with stronger internal trade links that could have similar Big Mac pricing due to shared market conditions. The Spinglass method can uncover more nuanced and multi-level communities, possibly highlighting intricate trade relationships and their cascading effects on the Big Mac Index."
